# TelesoftasTextWrapper
Home assignment

*	It was said to accept two args (text & length).
*	If text argument won't be passed, Wrapper will check the input file.

### Arguments:

Text:		-t "Green metal stick";  
Length:		-l 13;  



### Algorithm:

First I thought there a mistake, as wrapper should take as few lines as pissible, so the exsample should look like:  
123  
4 1  
123  
4  



*	Then I realized the effect of 'new lines' in input text.
*	Googled for algorithm, transformed it to concrete case.
